A stencil buffer is an extra data buffer, in addition to the color buffer and Z-buffer, 
found on modern graphics hardware. The buffer is per pixel and works on integer values, 
usually with a depth of one byte per pixel. The Z-buffer and stencil buffer often share the same area in the RAM 
of the graphics hardware.
